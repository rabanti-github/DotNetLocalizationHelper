# locbaml #

This is an attempt to modernize locbaml a little bit...

## ToDo

* Check reader/stream handling. Some values are cutted-off when loaded from the resource files
* Check licensing
  * The locbaml console application is currently an altered <strike>verbatim</strike> copy of https://github.com/JeremyDurnell/locbaml)
  * Licensing is still pendinng (Microsoft contacted)
  * Tool was altered to process streams instead of files (as is status not applicable anymore)
* UI implementation (WIP)
